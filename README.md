# Fertilizer Management System

This is a **Fertilizer Management System** built using **Flask, Pandas, and Excel**. It allows users to record fertilizer usage, view the number of records in the database, and download the data as an Excel file.

## Features
- Add new fertilizer records (customer name, date, fertilizer type, quantity, cost).
- Store data in an Excel file (`fertilizer_data.xlsx`).
- View a summary of the number of rows and columns.
- Download the Excel file containing all entries.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install flask pandas openpyxl
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the files to your project directory.
2. Run the Flask app:
   
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to:
   
   ```

   ```
